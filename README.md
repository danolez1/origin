### Origin Project: Theory of Everything

## Overview
The Origin Project aims to synthesize our understanding of the universe into a unified theory by treating the universe as a vast computer program. This repository will document and simulate the fundamental units of existence, the laws governing them, and their evolutionary processes using TypeScript.


## Fundamental Unit of Existence
### Classical and Quantum Properties
1. **Classical Properties**
   - Mass
   - Charge
   - Spin
   - Position
   - Velocity
   - Energy
   - Momentum
   - Size/Radius

2. **Quantum Properties**
   - Wavefunction
   - Superposition
   - Entanglement
   - Probability Amplitude
   - Quantization
   - Uncertainty

### Quantum Particles
- **Quarks**
- **Leptons**
- **Bosons**

## Historical Context

- **John Dalton (1766–1844)**

### Development of Quantum Theory
- **Max Planck (1900)**
- **Albert Einstein (1905)**
- **Niels Bohr (1913)**
- **Werner Heisenberg (1927)**
- **Paul Dirac (1928)**
- **Richard Feynman (1940s)**
